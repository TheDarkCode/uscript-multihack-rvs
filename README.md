Unreal Script Multi-Hack Base Source Code for Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield (Previously Unreleased)

You will need UMake (http://mb.link-m.de/umake/). Depending on what game version you are intending this to work on, you may need to adjust for variable changes, or operations being moved to Server-Side as part of anti-cheat updates. This cheat is still 100% undetectable when used with the proper injector and modified class names (e.g., change MultiHack class to your unique identifier).

Loading Ubot:

1. Put YourPackageName.ukx into your RavenShield/Animations folder.
2. Replace RavenShield.mod with the one located in RavenShield/Mods.
 - Optional, For Dot Reticule.
3. Start Tormentium.exe
4. Wait for game to load (make sure its in the default directory).
5. Make any small settings edits.
6. Now you can join any server.


** If the bot's package name becomes detected, change the package name
and then update the UInteractionLoader.ini file to your new package name.
